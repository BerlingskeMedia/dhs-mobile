NOTES

Spotted
------------------
Please note, that "spotted"-articles used as external links in the galeri queue are filtered away, since we have no API-access to theses.


Tag-pages/sections
------------------
We don't have a slug for the tags on articles. This means we can't link from an article to a tag or section using a slug. 
Because of that we have som sections in config and other sections/tag-pages.
